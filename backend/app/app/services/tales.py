    'summary': '''
The youngest of six mermaid princesses, the little mermaid is not only the most beautiful, but the most introspective and thoughtful. Since their mother has died, the mermaids are raised by their grandmother. The youngest asks for all the information she can get about the world above the sea. Each princess has her own sea garden, which she can decorate as she chooses. The youngest arranges everything in the shape of the sun, and places in it the statue of a handsome prince from a sunken ship.
As each princess reaches age 16, she is allowed to swim to the surface and observe life above the waves. When it is her turn to visit the upper world, the little mermaid approaches the windows of a sailing ship and sees inside the prince whose statue she has kept in her garden. A terrible storm comes up, wrecking the ship and drowning all on board except the prince. He is saved by the mermaid, who places him safely on a distant shore. When some maidens and a princess discover him, the little mermaid flees.
Her grandmother reveals the little mermaid can live on land, but at a terrible price. The sea witch has a potion that will transform her tail into legs and feet, but to get them, the little mermaid must give up her beautiful singing voice. And in order to gain a mortal soul, she must make the prince fall in love with and marry her.
She agrees, and though each step on land is like walking on knives, she manages to join the court of the prince. Despite her muteness, the prince treats her kindly. One day the princess who found him on the shore arrives and the prince, recognizing her as the one who saved him from drowning, vows his love for her. Together with the little mermaid, they sail away to their wedding. Her sisters bring the little mermaid a knife bought from the sea witch with their hair, instructing her to murder the prince with it so she can rejoin them in the sea. But the little mermaid is unable to do this. Brokenhearted, she kisses the happy couple and dives at sunrise to die in the waves of the sea. Instead, she finds herself lifted out of the water by the daughters of the air, who teach her how to bless children and thereby obtain an eternal soul.''',

A poor woodcutter and his wife had a three-year-old daughter that they could not feed.
The Virgin Mary appeared to the woodcutter and promised to take care of the child, so they gave her the child.
She grew up happily in Heaven. One day the Virgin had to go on a journey and gave the girl keys,
telling her she could open twelve doors but not the thirteenth. She opened the first twelve and found
the Apostles behind them. Then she opened the thirteenth door. Behind it was the Trinity, and her finger
was stained with gold. She tried to hide it, lying three times, and the Virgin Mary said she could no longer remain for her disobedience and lying.

She fell asleep and woke to find herself in a forest. Lamenting her misfortune, she lived in a hollow tree,
ate wild plants, and tore all her clothing until she was naked. One day, a king found her looking beautiful
but incapable of speech. He took her home and married her.

A year later, she had a son. The Virgin Mary appeared and demanded that she confess to having opened the door.
She lied again, the Virgin took her son, and the people whispered that she had killed and eaten the child.
In another year, she had another son, and it went as before. The third year, she had a daughter, and the Virgin Mary
took her to heaven and showed her her sons, but she would not confess. This time, the king could not restrain
his councilors, and the queen was condemned to death. When she was brought to the stake, she relented and wished
she could confess before she died. The Virgin Mary brought back her children, restored her the power of speech,
and gave her happiness the rest of her life.'''

Little Red Riding Hood walked happily to her grandmother’s house, but suddenly, a wolf appeared.
–          Where are you going, Little Red Riding Hood?
–          To my granny´s house, to give her these cakes.
The wolf convinced the girl to take a longer path while he took the short path, so
he could arrive before her and eat her grandmother. Then he ate Little red Riding Hood.
Later, after eating them, the wolf fell asleep beside the river. Suddenly, a woodcutter
saw him and took the little girl and her granny out of the wolf´s stomach and saved their lives.
Then he filled the wolf´s belly full of big stones and threw him into the river.'''
