    'text': '''
A poor woodcutter and his wife had a three-year-old daughter that they could not feed.
The Virgin Mary appeared to the woodcutter and promised to take care of the child, so they gave her the child.
She grew up happily in Heaven. One day the Virgin had to go on a journey and gave the girl keys,
telling her she could open twelve doors but not the thirteenth. She opened the first twelve and found
the Apostles behind them. Then she opened the thirteenth door. Behind it was the Trinity, and her finger
was stained with gold. She tried to hide it, lying three times, and the Virgin Mary said she could no longer remain for her disobedience and lying.

She fell asleep and woke to find herself in a forest. Lamenting her misfortune, she lived in a hollow tree,
ate wild plants, and tore all her clothing until she was naked. One day, a king found her looking beautiful
but incapable of speech. He took her home and married her.

A year later, she had a son. The Virgin Mary appeared and demanded that she confess to having opened the door.
She lied again, the Virgin took her son, and the people whispered that she had killed and eaten the child.
In another year, she had another son, and it went as before. The third year, she had a daughter, and the Virgin Mary
took her to heaven and showed her her sons, but she would not confess. This time, the king could not restrain
his councilors, and the queen was condemned to death. When she was brought to the stake, she relented and wished
she could confess before she died. The Virgin Mary brought back her children, restored her the power of speech,
and gave her happiness the rest of her life.'''

–          Where are you going, Little Red Riding Hood?
–          To my granny´s house, to give her these cakes.
The wolf convinced the girl to take a longer path while he took the short path, so
he could arrive before her and eat her grandmother. Then he ate Little red Riding Hood.
Later, after eating them, the wolf fell asleep beside the river. Suddenly, a woodcutter
saw him and took the little girl and her granny out of the wolf´s stomach and saved their lives.
