MERMAID = {
    'SUMMARY': '''
The youngest of six mermaid princesses, the little mermaid is not only the most beautiful, but the most introspective and thoughtful. Since their mother has died, the mermaids are raised by their grandmother. The youngest asks for all the information she can get about the world above the sea. Each princess has her own sea garden, which she can decorate as she chooses. The youngest arranges everything in the shape of the sun, and places in it the statue of a handsome prince from a sunken ship.
As each princess reaches age 16, she is allowed to swim to the surface and observe life above the waves. When it is her turn to visit the upper world, the little mermaid approaches the windows of a sailing ship and sees inside the prince whose statue she has kept in her garden. A terrible storm comes up, wrecking the ship and drowning all on board except the prince. He is saved by the mermaid, who places him safely on a distant shore. When some maidens and a princess discover him, the little mermaid flees.
Her grandmother reveals the little mermaid can live on land, but at a terrible price. The sea witch has a potion that will transform her tail into legs and feet, but to get them, the little mermaid must give up her beautiful singing voice. And in order to gain a mortal soul, she must make the prince fall in love with and marry her.
She agrees, and though each step on land is like walking on knives, she manages to join the court of the prince. Despite her muteness, the prince treats her kindly. One day the princess who found him on the shore arrives and the prince, recognizing her as the one who saved him from drowning, vows his love for her. Together with the little mermaid, they sail away to their wedding. Her sisters bring the little mermaid a knife bought from the sea witch with their hair, instructing her to murder the prince with it so she can rejoin them in the sea. But the little mermaid is unable to do this. Brokenhearted, she kisses the happy couple and dives at sunrise to die in the waves of the sea. Instead, she finds herself lifted out of the water by the daughters of the air, who teach her how to bless children and thereby obtain an eternal soul.''',
